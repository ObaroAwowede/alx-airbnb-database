<p>I wrote a query using an INNER JOIN to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings. The values i'm listing in the table are the user id, first name, last name, the booking status and total price</p>

<p>I also wrote a query using a LEFT JOIN to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews. The values i'm listig in the table are the property id, property name as wel as the review rating and comment</p>

<p>I wrote another query using a FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user. the values i'm listomg in the tbale are the user id, first name, last name, booking status and total price</p>
